# APIcture: Interactively exploring API structural changes and versioning consistency
In this page we present a comprehensive collection of visualization examples, including those featured in the paper, as well as additional examples that we find intriguing but were not included in the paper. For each visualization example, we provide relevant metadata related to the evolution of the subject, such as version numbers, timestamps, and release dates. Additionally, we specify the source OpenAPI Specification (OAS) used to generate the visualizations, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. Each example is accompanied by its corresponding visualization, allowing readers to explore and analyze the visual representations of API evolution. 

**Note that all the selected examples are real world APIs that are in production. **
